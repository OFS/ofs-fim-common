These scripts are copied to the bin directory of a release tree that is generated
by generate_pr_release.sh. generate_pr_release.sh is in the parent directory.
The scripts are not meant to be run here in release_bin.

Everything below the marker below will become the README at the top of the generated
tree.

=====================================
This template tree may be used to build any AFU partial reconfiguration area
for the FIM build from which it is derived. The tree is relocatable and may be
copied to a new location. It does not depend on files in the original FIM build.

If the OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT environment variable is set to this tree, the template
can be used with the standard OPAE SDK tools, such as afu_synth_setup for
synthesis and afu_sim_setup for simulation with ASE. Examples of builds using
this method can be found in https://github.com/OPAE/intel-fpga-bbb/tree/master/samples.

The Platform Interface Manager (PIM) is included in the template. The samples
above demonstrate methods of building platform-independent AFUs using the PIM.
PIM sources are in https://github.com/OPAE/ofs-platform-afu-bbb.
