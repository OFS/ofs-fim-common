These scripts are copied to the bin directory of a release tree that is generated
by generate_pr_release.sh. generate_pr_release.sh is in the parent directory.
The scripts are not meant to be run here in release_bin.

Everything below the marker below will become the README at the top of the generated
tree.

=====================================
This template tree may be used to build any AFU partial reconfiguration area
for the FIM build from which it is derived. The tree is relocatable and may be
copied to a new location. It does not depend on files in the original FIM build.

If the OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT environment variable is set to this tree, the template
can be used with the standard OPAE SDK tools, such as afu_synth_setup for
synthesis and afu_sim_setup for simulation with ASE. Examples of builds using
this method can be found in https://github.com/OFS/examples-afu.

The Platform Interface Manager (PIM) is included in the template. The samples
above demonstrate methods of building platform-independent AFUs using the PIM.
PIM sources are in https://github.com/OFS/ofs-platform-afu-bbb.

Scripts:

afu_synth

  The primary build script for a configured PR instance. It is a wrapper around
  the standard Quartus flow and is equivalent to compilation within the Quartus
  GUI.


build_env_config

  Contains environment variables with parameters unique to the release, such
  as the path from a configured AFU tree to the root of the Quartus project.
  build_env_config is sourced by other scripts in this directory.


qar_gen

  Generate a Quartus archive of a configured PR instance. The script may be run
  from the root of a tree configured by afu_synth_setup or from a Quartus project
  directory. It sets switches to Quartus archive that write the full compilation
  database to a qar file, allowing for Quartus builds of the restored project.


update_pim

  Performs an in-place update of the Platform Interface Manager (PIM) in the
  release tree. This script is rarely used, except by developers of the PIM.
  It updates the PIM instance from PIM sources within the tree (using
  $OFS_PLATFORM_AFU_BBB) without having to rebuild the FIM or generate a new
  PR release.
