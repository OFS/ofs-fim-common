                Generate configuration data for the IOPLL
                =========================================

OVERVIEW:

These scripts facilitate the creation of configuration data to be used
with the IOPLL IP. The output of these scripts is a C header file
called: user_clk_iopll_freq.h. Currently, a version of this header
file resides in the OPAE project at:

libopae/src/usrclk/user_clk_iopll_freq.h


FILES:
======

generate_pll_settings_s10.tcl:
-----------------------------

The generate_pll_settings_s10.tcl script was provided by the openCL
team. It is designed to generate 1x and 2x clock signals. The script
receives parameters for the reference frequency and for the desired
1x frequency.  The payload output from this script goes to a local
file named pll_config.bin, and looks like the following:

600000 1542 65536 257 257 192 4 0

These are all decimal values, and are defined as follows, in the same
order as shown above:

(1) pll_freq_khz: The resulting 1x frequency in KHz
(2) pll_m:  M counter values
(3) pll_n:  M counter values
(4) pll_c1: C1 counter values
(5) pll_c0: C0 counter values
(6) pll_lf: Loop filter values
(7) pll_cp: Charge pump values
(8) pll_rc: Ripplecap values

The generate_pll_settings_s10.tcl script has been modified for
Stratix 10 by implementing a frequency range for 1x from 10MHz to
600MHz. The 2x clock will be double the 1x clock until the 1x clock
exceeds 300MHz. For the 1x frequency range of 301MHz to 600 MHz, the
2x output will be the same as the 1x output.

iopll_gen_config_data.py:
------------------------

The iopll_gen_config_data.py python script automates the process of 
generating the user_clk_iopll_freq.h C Header file by calling the
generate_pll_settings_s10.tcl once for each desired frquency in a
given range. The parameters for this script are currently hardwired
as constants within the script:

    REF_FREQ = 100
    MIN_FREQ = 10
    MAX_FREQ = 600
    C_HEADER = "user_clk_iopll_freq.h"

Note that the MIN_FREQ and MAX_FREQ constants are both associated
with the 1x output frequency.
